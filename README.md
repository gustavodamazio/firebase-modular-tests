# Firebase Modular Tests

- @angular/fire@7.6.1 | Firebase@9.23.0 | rxfire@6.0.3
- This is a simple project to demonstrate how to test Firebase Modular.

The objective of this project is to check how modular Firebase behaves on the non-modular Firebase side, to facilitate project compatibility, which has a lot of non-modular Firebase code.
